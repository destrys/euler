# Project Euler 
---

This repo contains my code for solving the problems presented by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

**Warning**: Don't look at the code unless you want to to have your world spoiled. Each Problem has it's own file and README,
but I don't hide the punchline. Explore at your own risk.
